# Discord Temporary Voice Channels

This library works the same way its parent does (see [discord-temp-channels](https://github.com/Androz2091/discord-temp-channels) of [Androz2091](https://github.com/Androz2091)) except that it brings a few new features:

- more events like `voiceChannelCreate` and **4 more**
- give the temporary channels' owner the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission on them
- give more permissions to users/roles when channels are created (via registered parent options)
- auto-prefix renamed temporary channels if the prefix is missing
- reload temporary channels in memory in case the bot restarts while the feature is being used
- Source code embedded documentation with [JSDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc)

See [./examples/index.js](https://github.com/trickstarcandina/discord-temp-channels/tree/master/examples/index.js) and [./examples/index2.js](https://github.com/trickstarcandina/discord-temp-channels/tree/master/examples/index2.js).

## Prerequisites ⚠️

Starting at **v2.0.0**, you must use **NodeJS v16.6.0 or higher** to run a bot with this library.

You also must not forget to include [mandatory intents](#mandatory-intents) as well as give your bot the rights to [use application commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#authorizing-your-application).

### Mandatory intents

- GUILD_VOICE_STATE: used to detect guild members voice state updates (when someone joins a voice channel, leaves or changes from one to another, ...).
- GUILDS: used to recover from possible crashes of your bot (detects and reconstructs the temporary channels list and deletes them if necessary).

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save @trickstarcandina/discord-temp-channels
```

## Events

manager.on(
